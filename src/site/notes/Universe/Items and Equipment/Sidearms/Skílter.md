***An [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n flyblade.** Forged in the molten star [[Universe/The World of Ode/Volhal\|Volhal]], this air-light knife is foiled in multiplicity. Skílter can be thrown across a [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Skytower\|Skytower]] while never leaving its master's hand. Such blades are common gifts to honour superiors and say more about status than utility. Yet those of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Grace\|Grace]] may fly death upon her tiny wings.*
