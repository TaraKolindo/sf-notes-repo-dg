*A full set of three Precklies. Part of a traditional [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] game called [[Preck\|Preck]]. The rules are simple- each player has three chances to strike a target with these small but mighty blades. These Precklies are child-sized, likely a [[bloomsday\|bloomsday]] gift for a [[Universe/Factions and Species/Knightmaidens\|knightmaiden]] in training. As such, they are surely well accustomed to meeting their mark.*
