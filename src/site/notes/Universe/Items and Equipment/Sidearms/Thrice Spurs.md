***The thrice spurned flyblades of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]].** Crafted by the hero's own half-brother, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Pothus\|Pothus]], after the great [[Universe/Events/The Felling\|Felling]] war. Thrice spurned was the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress]] of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Eldveil\|Eldveil]], one blade for each of her Wyld betrayers. From holster to hilts, these ceremonial flyblades were forged, etched, and gifted to Tethren in complete silence.*
