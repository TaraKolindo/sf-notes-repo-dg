*The crackle of lightning, bottled up one's sleeve. Odiac is the mechanical power source of [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n casters. Fixed upon the wrists, its rapidly oscillating spheres generate voltaic charge. With no more than a gesture, its master may cast homing bolts of lightning and summon [[Lectric Shields\|Lectric Shields]] at will.*
