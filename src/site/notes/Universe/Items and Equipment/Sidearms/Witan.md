***Childblade to the glorious [[Universe/Items and Equipment/Weapons/Dewelion\|Dewelion]].** Our oldest tales tell of sacred unions between human and [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|fey]]-kind. [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Of children who are neither, yet both]]. Witan was forged for such a child, its wooden hilt enchanted to grow in pace. Though... It is clear this childblade never reached its full size.*
