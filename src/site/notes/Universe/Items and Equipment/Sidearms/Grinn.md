***The toothed sawblade of [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sinecure\|Sinecure]] trappers.** Hooked and barbed like wardog teeth, Grinn finds the grip of any so ruthless. Though the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]] prefer to hunt in legions, 'tis custom to carry such a sawblade on solitary journeys. Tucked close to it's master's side, Grinn makes for a fierce companion with a ripping bite... Near drooling for prey.*
