*A ritual dagger, aglow with moonlight. A fine point, more handle than blade, Virdigris seeks sacrifice. She is wrought with copper, a cleansing metal meant to protect the holder from what vengeful spirit may lurch from its mark. The innermost ring of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Iridis\|Iridis]] is her namesake. May that be the fate of your fallen.*
