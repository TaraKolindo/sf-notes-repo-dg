***The stolen dagger of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]].** In the wake of [[Universe/Events/The Felling\|the Felling]], the trickster Sirin snuck an enchanted flame blade from [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]]'s own mantle. With delicate archer's hands, he snaked a [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Iridis\|moonstone]] into its hilt, marking it as his own Cobladh Dagger. It was stolen from him by his daughter, and from her by her son. And now... It is yours.*
