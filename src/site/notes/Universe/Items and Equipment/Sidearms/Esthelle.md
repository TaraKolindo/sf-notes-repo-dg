***The magick globes of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]].** [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Alca\|Alca]]'s magicks, distilled into globes of the witch's own conjuring. 'Tis said when [[Universe/Events/The Felling\|the Felling]] fires were quenched, Oscelda retreated to her [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|wevetroot]] study. So guilt-stricken was she, so desperate to cast a spell that would right her wrongs, she conjured Esthelle. Three orbs, three amends, should she ever meet the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress]] again. Of course, she would not.*
