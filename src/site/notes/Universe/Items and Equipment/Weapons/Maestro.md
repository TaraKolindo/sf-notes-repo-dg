*A ceremonial bow of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] [[Universe/The World of Alca/Festivals/Thawtide\|Thawtide]] tradition. Maestro is a hunter's bow, simple in make but for its uniquely carved arrows. When plucked and loosed just so, the wind whistles through the fletching to mimic the call of the Cardinal. Each year, just before Thawtide's final dawn, ‘tis the hunter's rite to summon the flock to darkest sky. One long whistle to cue the chorus. For it is the Cardinals’ morning song that wakes [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] from her longest slumber.*
