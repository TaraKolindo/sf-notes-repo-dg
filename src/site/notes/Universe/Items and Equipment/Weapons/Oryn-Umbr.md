*Oryn, an [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n short sword tipped by an eclipse. Its hollowed blade lightens the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sinecure\|Sinecure]] swing, so it may be wielded by only one hand. Umbr, a shield aglow with Ode'n sigil. [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Skytower\|Skytower]]s loft are mapped in blue upon its tempered face. Cast in lightweight alloys, Umbr is forged to be thrown as a starnshot blazing.*
