*The ere pronged Glaive of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]].*

*No mortal weapon has points so fine nor plenty as the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Omen Beast\|Omen Beast]]'s own crown. Though this charger's lance comes close. Dual spires are cast of gold as old as the line of Rood. The oaken staff is freshly bound and still smells of forest.*
