*The [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Kane/Steelsinger Kane\|Steelsinger Kane]] wrought two flaming blades from the fire of the binary suns - [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] and [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]].*

*For four summers his young pupil [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/Fenn Jotar\|Fenn]] toiled under master Kane to forge the Sun blades. Pleading each passing year to take one for himself, Kane refused to strike them complete. So smaller of hilt yet finer of point, Fenn stole Igne Mora away in the night and bade never to return.*

*By legend, Kane returned the forsaken twin to the fire with a curse that would grant the impatient prince no peace thereafter.*
