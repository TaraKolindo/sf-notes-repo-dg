*A witching-staff of alder.*

*Though its curling boughs look natural as wind, Gwylen was hand-shaped by [[Universe/Factions and Species/Aureli jardiniers\|Aureli jardiniers]]. Not carved, but grown into delicate curves - finely tuned to facilitate the flow of magic. To grow a single wand takes years. A staff like Gwylen, a lifetime.*
