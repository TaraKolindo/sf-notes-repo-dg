*A hefty training sword, forged many generations ago.*

*Though its hilt has known many young soldiers to be, Wulder is not so worn as it is old. You imagine this broadsword respectfully retired. A mantlepiece hung above a [[Universe/Locations/Curlail\|Curlailan]] hearth. Warming. Waiting. For the fated hand of its final student.*
