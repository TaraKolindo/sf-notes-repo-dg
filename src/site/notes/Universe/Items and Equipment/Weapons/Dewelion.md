***A [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]] warrior's gloryblade.** Dewelion is a word of the ancient Fey tongue. It means something like 'horizon;' a confluence of opposites; where day and night may meet. For a human steelsinger to have sung these delicate pieces back to former glory... An impossible confluence indeed.*
