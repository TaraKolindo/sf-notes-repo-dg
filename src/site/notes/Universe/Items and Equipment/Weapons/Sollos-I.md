*A standard issue broadsword for [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n [[Universe/The World of Ode/Gruul\|G]][[Universe/Enemies/Gruul-Seekers\|ruul-Seekers]]. Though this model is outdated, its blade remains finely pointed. The worn handholds on either side of the hilt indicate two wielders. The first carried the Sollos-I in their right hand, the other, likely a new recruit using a retired sword to train, swung it in their left.*
