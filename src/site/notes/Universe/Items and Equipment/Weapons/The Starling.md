***The [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]]bow of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] legend.** Strung taut with the golden eyelash of the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress Alora]], of spider silk weaver-wound. Stolen way 'fore it could be gifted. Such is the grace of the Starling Bow, its wind blades guarding the [[Universe/Items and Equipment/Resources/Sappheline\|Sappheline]] orb from those who may steal it back. Enchanted by the grace of the rogue, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]], and the sacrifice of the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress]] of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Eldveil\|Eldveil]], both. Wield your ancestral arm with pride, child of Sirin.*
