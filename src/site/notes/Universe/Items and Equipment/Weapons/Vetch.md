*The swiftsword Vetch. Slender and pliant, this sword is of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] weapon class 'Illanfeoir' meaning blade of grass. Vetch is unadorned but for a single blue crystal embedded in its hilt- a tear of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Iridis\|Iridis]]. Likely a weapon wrought in the name of a loved one lost.*
