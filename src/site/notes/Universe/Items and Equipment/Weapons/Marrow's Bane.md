***A mighty claw, a dripping maw. The menacing cleaver of the Arbearer, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Bromius\|Bromius]].** Five sharpened spires glint in the pale [[Universe/Locations/Neath'uns\|Neath'uns]] light. Be they the teeth of Marrow's Bane? Or the claws of the great Omen Bear himself? Wield this weapon by the Arbrearer's deal: to protect the old roots yet to heal- or to pick your teeth after good meal.*
