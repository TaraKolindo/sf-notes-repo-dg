***The flameblade of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] legend.** Forged from the femur of the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress Alora]], of alloys dug from the deepest of hollow hills. Marrow binds the Ivor Blade. The snaking sword curls like eager flame, stoked by the burning orb of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]nite embedded within. Enchanted by the courage of the warrior, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]], and the sacrifice of the Empress of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Eldveil\|Eldveil]], both. Wield your ancestral arm with pride, child of Tethren.*
