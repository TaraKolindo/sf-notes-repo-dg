*A well-worn hunter's bow.*

*Lightweight and well-balanced despite its age, Thistle has the mark of a [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Rood]]s craftsman. The handle is grooved around your fingertips like an old friend. You've much in common with whoever held it last (AN: prob [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Grandfather\|Grandfather]]). Of that, you are certain.*
