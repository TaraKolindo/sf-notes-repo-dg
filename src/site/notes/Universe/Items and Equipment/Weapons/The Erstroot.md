***A witching-staff of [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|Wevet]]root.** Plucked from [[Universe/Locations/The Wastegraves\|The Wastegraves]] by the [[Universe/Characters/Mendicant/Wazzard of the Wastes\|Wazzard]]'s own hand, a creeping root steeped in ichor. Be it [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n corruption that grants it such power? The darkened trace of magick sap? Or an ancient curse from the [[Universe/Characters/Mendicant/Wazzard of the Wastes\|Waste Wraith]] himself?*
