*A deadly [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n Halberd lost to the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sinecure\|Sinecure]] ranks not long ago.*

*Though the blade is rusted slightly, it is only for the Ode'n alloys, untreated for humid [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Alca\|Alcan]] air. Assuredly, it is no less sharp, nor acutely balanced, than the night of its extraction from Ode'n mound.*
