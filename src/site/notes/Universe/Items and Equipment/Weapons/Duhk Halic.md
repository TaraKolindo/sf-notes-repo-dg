*Forged of fever, wrought of wrath. [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n lance, Duhk Halic.*

*An Ode'n instrument of corruption. Even the [[Universe/Characters/Ode'n/Sinecure/Nimrod\|Nimrod]] who wields it suffers from its venomous touch. Whether [[Universe/Factions and Species/Omen Beast\|Omen Beast]] or sacred tree, wherever Duhk Halic finds its mark, a wound spews ichor. Though... your weaver ways seem to have purged this wretched lance of corruption... For now.*
