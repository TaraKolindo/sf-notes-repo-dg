***The sacred staff of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] legend.** A finger snapped from the tender hand of the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress Alora]], from the sacred arm of her Alder tree. Arcing branches dipped in gold, hold an orb of glowing moonstone like so many clasped hands. Enchanted by the spirit of the witch, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]], and the sacrifice of the Empress of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Eldveil\|Eldveil]], both. Wield your ancestral arm with power, child of Oscelda.*
