***A finely balanced bow of [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n make.** Invented shortly after the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Alca\|Alca]]n conquest. Taking amusement from the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] hunters' primitive weapon of choice, Ode'n blademakers crafted the Blitzel from the many discarded bows littering the late battlefield. Thus, a new addition to the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sinecure\|Sinecure]] Armamentarium.*
