**A ritual dagger of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] [[Universe/The World of Alca/Festivals/Thawtide\|Thawtide]] tradition.** So large a dagger, yet so peaceful a purpose. Rostrum is a hunter's blade named after the beaks of the birds it feeds. 'Tis the work of the young to find flowers in frost, and the work of the elders to slice out the seeds one by one. Only the finest of these befit the crimson beaks of [[Universe/Factions and Species/The Cardinals\|Cardinals]], for it is their work to wake the sun from the longest night of the year. And hungry work it is.
