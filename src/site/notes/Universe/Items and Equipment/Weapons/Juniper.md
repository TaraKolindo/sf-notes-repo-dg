***[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Grandfather\|Grandfather]]'s bow. So named after the sacred tree from which she was hewn.** She is twisted fair of living wood like her sister bow, [[Dhonu\|Dhonu]]. Even her quiver breaths life. Charmed, she grows arrows near as fast as Grandfather can loose them. Though these days, they both grow slower. On either end, the curling boughs wrap 'round a [[Salz Agate\|Salz Agate]]. This precious stone was once believed to bridge the realms between man and [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]]. Much like their master.*
