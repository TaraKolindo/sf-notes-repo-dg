*Borne of a moonlight pond, was he, with an arrow ready-nocked. Take the pact of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]] assassin, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]]. Learn the trickster's glamour, wear the ranger's shroud. Have [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Grace\|Grace]], [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]]. For a well-aimed bolt may end a world. It has done so once before.*
