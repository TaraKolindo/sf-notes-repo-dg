*Royal tines thus graced in blue, Skyward bent to [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] true. Take ye the pact of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]], the great spirit stag of the [[Universe/Locations/Andurin Glades\|Andurin Glades]]. Bear blessing and burden of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] herds through bounty of seedtime and hollow of frostfall, both.*
