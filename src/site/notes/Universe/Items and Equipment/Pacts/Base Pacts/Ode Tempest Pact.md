***Lightning cracks where thunder bodes. Voltaics strike against their own. Rebind your arm to [[Universe/Factions and Species/Tempest\|Tempest]] [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]].** Harness the power of Ode'n technology. Though freed you are, your Tempest training may prove useful still. May they rue the day they stole your frame.*
