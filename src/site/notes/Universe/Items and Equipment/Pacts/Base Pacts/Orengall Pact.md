***Sleek as silvern, sharp as bone. Hear ye howls and know ye're home. For by her pact, no wolf be lone.** Be one with the Pack of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Omen Beast\|Omen]] shewolf [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Orengall\|Orengall]]. Prowl the Furthing packlands by light of Iridis, a silent assassin of fang and claw. May your bite be fierce and your love be fiercer.*
