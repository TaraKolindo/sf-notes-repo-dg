*Her ever-flame will she impart, To braving souls with burning hearts. Not life nor death will do you part. Take [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]'s Hand, [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]]. Make a pact with the red sun. An honour once held only by the mighty Kings and Queens of [[Universe/Locations/Midrath\|Midrath]] is yours. Do not sully her flame.*
