***[[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] soul from dolmen grave. [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]] grace this [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]] frame. By plucked lash, by archer's aim.** Take the pact of the Wyld assassin, Sirin. Learn the trickster's glamour, wear the ranger's shroud. Have [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Grace\|Grace]], Envoy. For a well-aimed bolt may end a world. It has done so once before.*
