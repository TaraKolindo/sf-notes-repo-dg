***Wyld soul from dolmen grave. [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]] bless this [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]] frame. By finger snapped, in magick's name.** Share the pact of the [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] witch, Oscelda. Fend the thriving, tend the ailing, and mend the damned. Have [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Spirit\|Spirit]], Envoy. For all of us living share the same breath. Forget it is so, and choke.*
