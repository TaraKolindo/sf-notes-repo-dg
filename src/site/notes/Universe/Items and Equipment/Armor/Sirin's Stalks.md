***Typical trousers lined in lowry leaves.** Each step you take falls silent. These trousers do not rustle as you move, nor sound when brushed against a branch, a stalk. A trick of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|the old Fey trickster]] himself. Such shadow imbued lowry leaves leave you utterly quiet.*
