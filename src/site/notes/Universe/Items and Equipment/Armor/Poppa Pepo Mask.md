***An homage to a sinister [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sproutfolk\|Sproutfolk]] legend.** The warty mask of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Alca's Children/Sproutfolk/Bita's Eve legends/Poppa Pepo\|Poppa Pepo]], husband to [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Alca's Children/Sproutfolk/Bita's Eve legends/Crone Curcubita\|The Crone]], bringer of the blight. Each [[Universe/The World of Alca/Festivals/Bita's Eve\|Bita's Eve]], Sproutfolk rush to harvest the last of their crops before moonrise draws the fog tides in. For that is when Poppa Pepo makes his great sigh. Any stalk that feels his blighted breath will be rotted 'way by morning.*
