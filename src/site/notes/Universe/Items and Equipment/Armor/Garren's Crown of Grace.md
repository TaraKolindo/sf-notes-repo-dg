***The kettle helm of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]] is blessed by grace of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Omen Beast\|Omen Beast]]'s own crown.** Glowing tips of the iron antler reach skyward to [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]'s divine power, while the sculpted cap points forward, a weapon of focused will. By the stag's wreath of bone, wield your will with pride.*
