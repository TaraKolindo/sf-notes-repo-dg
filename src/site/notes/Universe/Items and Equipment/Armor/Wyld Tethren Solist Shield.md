***The heavy armour of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Solist\|Solist]] [[Universe/Factions and Species/Solist Warrior\|Warriors]].** The folded regalia marks a lifetime of training. So too does the iron breastplate, shaped in perfect form of the muscled frame underneath. The battalion of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]], riders of the suns. Betrayed by their own commanding Chief.* 
([[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]])

"Betrayed by their own commanding Chief." What does this mean??? Who is this commanding Chief?
