***[[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]]'s Beltolls ring for all, though not all can hear them.** [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|Wevetroots]] wind their way across the armour, an enchanted embrace. From the draping cape hangs countless silver bells, ringing in a pitch only the rivers can hear.*
