***Soft as moonlight, light as stars, the flowing pendelveil of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]].** Woven entirely of [[Universe/Items and Equipment/Resources/Moonsteel Thread\|Moonsteel Thread]], the veil feels silky upon the skin while providing the protection of a very fine chainmail. A blessing bell hangs from the end of the long wrapping fabric.*
