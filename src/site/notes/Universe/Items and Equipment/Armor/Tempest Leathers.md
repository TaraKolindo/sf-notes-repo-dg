***Infamously adorned by a variety of buckles and straps, the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Tempest\|Tempest]] brigandine is designed to fit every shape of [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]] conscript.** From the statuesque [[Universe/Factions and Species/Knightmaidens\|Knightmaidens]] of [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendria]] to the diminutive farmfolk of the lowlands, Ode'n leathers may be fit and refit to any of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Thrall\|Thrall]] as many times as casualties call.*
