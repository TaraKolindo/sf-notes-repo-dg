***A tattered old apron fashioned of scrap leather.** Good for catching stray sparks and not much else. Rough and ragged as it is, this belted balm-cloth is a testament to the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Steelsinger's Guild\|Steelsinger]]'s code; To make what one needs, and naught more, from what one has, and naught less.*
