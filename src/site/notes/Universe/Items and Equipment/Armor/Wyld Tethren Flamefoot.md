***The same sabatons that marched those flaming fields so many ages ago.** The spurning knees, the proud-tipped toes, the armour of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]] steelsung back to life. Even now, it carries the worth of a battle won... and the weight of war's cost.*
