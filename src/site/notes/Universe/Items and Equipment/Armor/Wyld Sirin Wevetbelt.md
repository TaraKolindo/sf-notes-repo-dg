***The rich leathers of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]] [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]], wrapped in [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|wevetroot]].** The well-fitted boots move soft and swift, the hanging shroud, a shadow. Yet a wevetbelt coaxed round the waist feels out of place... A gift from Wyld [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]]? Or more likely a tricker's spoils.*
