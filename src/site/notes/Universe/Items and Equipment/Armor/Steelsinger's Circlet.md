***A brass circlet branded by the rising sun.** 'Tis the symbol of the prentice, the lowest rank of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Steelsinger's Guild\|Steelsinger's Guild]]. Malleable, and apt for resmelting, the brass circlet is often forged by the prentice themself as a first test of skill. This one is exceptionally crafted.*
