***The noble pact-holder to [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]] must be decorated as a true Knight of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Grace\|Grace]].** Cast in careful faulds of oak-infused iron, this armour bestows upon the wearer the will of the stag. Careful prints of antlers span like shadows from elbow to shoulder; a mark of pride withstanding darkness and light.*
