***The weathered helm of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/The Circade\|The Circade]].** Preserved in tomb for centuries, the Helm of Deceit holds still the air of its former wearer. Slippery. Cool. Imposing. The metal shell echoes when worn like the inside of [[Universe/Locations/Kearnhold\|Kearnhold]] bells.*
