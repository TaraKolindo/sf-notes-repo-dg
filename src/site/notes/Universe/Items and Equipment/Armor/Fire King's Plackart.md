*The gilded plackart of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/Fenn Jotar\|Fenn Jotar]] is wrought of a once heat-resistant alloy devised by the Fire King's own royal smith, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/Karlik the Torrid\|Karlik the Torrid]]. Though many years branded beside Fenn Jotar's [[Universe/Items and Equipment/Weapons/Igne Mora\|legendary flaming sword]] diminished these properties, the armour remains cool to touch.*
