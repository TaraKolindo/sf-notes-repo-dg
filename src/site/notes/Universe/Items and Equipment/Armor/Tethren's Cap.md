***The feather-light leather cap of a [[Universe/Factions and Species/Solist\|Solist]] [[Universe/Factions and Species/Solist Warrior\|Warrior]].** Though traditionally worn to pad a heavy metal helm, this braveling's cap will grant light protection in a pinch. Flowing red drapes brush your cheeks like [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]'s sunning rays.*
([[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]])
