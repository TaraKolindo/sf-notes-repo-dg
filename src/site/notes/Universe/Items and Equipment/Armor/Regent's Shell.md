*Gauntlets of swirling ore honour [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] and [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]] entwined. An emblem broach of flaxen wheat honours the fields of home, graced by twin suns to cultivate growths. Relics all from the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Knightmaidens\|Knightmaidens]]' noble age.*
([[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Knightmaidens/Lady Deora\|Lady Deora]])
