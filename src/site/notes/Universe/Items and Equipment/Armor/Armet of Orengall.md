*Graced by the blue gleam of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Iridis\|Iridis]] full is [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Orengall\|Orengall]]'s legendary Armet. Crafted for the hunter shrouded by night, quicksilver alloys ensure a silent stalk and merciful strike. By focused glare of the waxing moon, you call upon the rite of the lone wolf's fang.*
