***A slender sleeve of [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|fey]]ish blue to match [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|your]] magick arm.** Humble as these clothes may be, they feel petal-soft on the skin. It is the way of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|witches]] to dress lightly. Flowing fabrics such as these keep one close as can be to the magicks, ever-floating, on the wind.*
