***A Great Helm cast tall as a pillar of flame.** Oft worn in place of the [[Universe/Locations/Midrath\|Midrath]]ian crown, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/Fenn Jotar\|Fenn Jotar]]'s beloved helmet marked the Fire King's devotion to the sun goddesses [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] and [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]]. Pilfered from the [[Universe/Locations/Dermak Undercity\|Undercity]] catacombs during his kingdom's [[Universe/Events/Lightless Era\|Lightless Era]], Fenn Jotar himself affixed fish and flame motifs to mark this antique by the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Clan Jotar\|House of Jotar]].*
