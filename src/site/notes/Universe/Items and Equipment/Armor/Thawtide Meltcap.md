*A hiemal helm shaped like a snow-covered pine tree. Though the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Weatherer\|Weatherer]]s have warmed [[Universe/Locations/Midrath\|Midrath]]'s atmosphere 'yond any chance of snow, a hint of the old ways still lingers in this traditional helm. Once worn by the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Longnight Elder\|Longnight Elder]]s during the great [[Universe/Factions and Species/The Cardinals\|Cardinals]]' vigil. Now, a sick costume.*
