***Proud-footed boots with upturned toes.** The yellow enamel poleyns shine with the symbol of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Solist\|Solist]]. March forth, warrior, in the name of the mighty [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]] fleet. On each fair footfall, hear the tapping heels of the many lost who march beside you.*
