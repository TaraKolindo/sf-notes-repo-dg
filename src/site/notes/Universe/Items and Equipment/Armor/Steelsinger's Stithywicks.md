***A clothen scarf for wicking sweat, lest it fall upon a fresh tempered blade.** A length of arm-glove for grazing flame, lest a hammered hilt slip into the forge. Each piece of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Steelsinger's Guild\|Steelsinger's]] armour is worn not for the protection of the wearer, but for the protection of their precious craft.*
