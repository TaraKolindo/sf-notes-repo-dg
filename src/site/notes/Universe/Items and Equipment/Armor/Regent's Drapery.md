***Flowing skirts and capes are intricately woven by [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendria]]'s master webbers.** Though each weave is completely unique, they all share a single flaw. The [[Universe/The World of Alca/Silvern\|Silvern]]slip. An intentionally skipped stitch, a silent rebellion, of which the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]] know not.*
