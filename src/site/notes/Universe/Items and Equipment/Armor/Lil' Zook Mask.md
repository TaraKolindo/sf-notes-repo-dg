***An homage to a sinister [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sproutfolk\|Sproutfolk]] legend.** The hallowed face of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Alca's Children/Sproutfolk/Bita's Eve legends/Crone Curcubita\|Crone Curcubita]]'s undead child. Each [[Universe/The World of Alca/Festivals/Bita's Eve\|Bita's Eve]], she digs [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Alca's Children/Sproutfolk/Bita's Eve legends/Lil' Zook\|Lil' Zook]] from his cursed field. For one night, he roams from patch to patch, seeking a Sproutling out past bedtime to take his place... Lest moonset strikes and she buries him once more.*
