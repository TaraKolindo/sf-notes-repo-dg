***A brazen diadem forged in the style of the healer [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]].** When placed upon your head, you see her face. But for a moment, the wide blue eyes of The [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]]ish Witch of Legend. They say her diadem of thorns was a gift from [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress]] herself.*
