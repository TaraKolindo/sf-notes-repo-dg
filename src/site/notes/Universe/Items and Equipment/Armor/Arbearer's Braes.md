***The [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Bromius\|Arbearer]]'s laden boots. As thick as [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|Wevet]]roots.** A bastion of straps support poleyns and mail. Heavy iron plates guard each and every toe. Though the Arbearer's soles are sewn in soft leather. Gentle. So as not to disturb the tender sprouts underfoot.*
