[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Grandfather\|Grandfather]] Doyen: "[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|Minnow]]! Minnow! Let's rouse the eldish melodies from that sleepy soul of yours, eh? [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]] or not, my minnow will know the grace of music! [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]'s Morning?! You know that song? To practice! The magick. It's in you. Yours. Like the wind."

[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|???]]: "Like your blood. Ancient as your [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Wyld\|Wyld]]. Which was yours- no- let me guess!"
	When selecting [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]]:
		"Rogue to [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]]..."
	When selecting [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]]:
		"Warrior of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]..."
	When selecting [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]]:
		"Shaman of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Iridis\|Iridis]]..."
Doyen: "Feel it like rain. Breathe it like wind. All of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Alca\|Alca]]'s making is magick. So wield it- Or yield to it. Once you've learned, that is a choice only you can make. Know who were the bad'uns before even [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]? Us, that's who! Blight 'a blue. No human hue. (AN: is this referring to the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]]s or [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]]? or both?) O, they'd round us up or drown us down. Lest we 'come witches! There's a wee touch o' magick mulch in you, sure. But yer stooped with reason and sense too much for a garden. Prove me wrong, guppy!"

When choosing Oscelda:
	???: "A blessed babe of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Oscelda\|Oscelda]] you are! May you find me in need of healing. May you be the one who made it so."
When choosing Sirin:
	???: "Child of my trickster [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Sirin\|Sirin]], I should have known. Have you too a dagger for my back? I hope!"
When selecting Tethren:
	???: "Ah, descendant of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/Tethren\|Tethren]]. May your sword find respect. Or once more, my neck? [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/The Great Spyder\|The Great Spyder]] will tell."

Doyen: "Might be hope for our minnow yet! An Envoy you'll be lest the Ode get you fore."

Granfa is gone, but his Sparrow will guide you:
Doyen: "Go 'n play long the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|fey]]-lane ways! All this yabber and jabber and thinking. You'll find no wolf-riders in a library... but keep yer eyes on the sky, just in case. Oh! And 'appy [[Bairnday\|Bairnday]]!"

[[Universe/Characters/Ode'n/Sinecure/Nimrod\|Nimrod]]: "Hark! Hail! THUNDER."
???: "Wet with salt, did she exalt, the Isle she swam unto."
