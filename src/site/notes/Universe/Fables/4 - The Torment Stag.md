[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Knightmaidens/Lady Deora\|Lady Deora]] (through a vision): "By [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]'n reign... this beast, we claim!"

[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/The Pensives/Orlick\|Orlick]]: "Dreams. Their meaning, like a river, curving beyond sight. (whispering) Yes, that is a good title!"

Orlick: "[[Universe/Factions and Species/Sinecure\|Sinecure]]. Mercenaries of the [[Universe/Characters/Ode'n/Synod\|Synod]] above. If there exists a soulless creature, one need only look skyward."

[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Alca's Children/Sproutfolk/Avakot\|Avakot]]: "Get me... (sneezes) out of here! Hey! Give me a hand, would ya? Big-legs, a little help? By sun's arse, been waitin' to get that out for days. You 'ere lookin' for that monstered-up [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Stag]], I bet."

[[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|The Envoy]]: "What do you know?"

Avakot: "Ah, nuffin' really. Just how it lives in a [[Universe/Locations/Andurin Glades\|secret-y glade]] hidden by ancient magicks. And... how to find said secret-y glade and disenchant said ancient magicks. (sneezes) Few [[Universe/The World of Alca/Dracs\|Dracs]] and I'm an open scroll..."

The Envoy: "I'm a little, uh, short..."
	Avakot: "Wait a seed. I saw you nail one of those sludgers, didn't I? On the patch, friend."
The Envoy: "I could crate you up again..."
	Avakot: "Now the price will be- ah- (sneezes) doubled. Smart ass."
The Envoy: "You rather the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]] have him?"
	Avakot: "Okay, big-legs, I get it..."
Pay 80 Dracs:
	Avakot: "Thank-- Damn. I thought that was gonna be a good 'un that was."

Avakot: "Your problem is, from the ground, the glade's all puckered up... ya need the right totem to tickle it open! Lucky for you, I've got one stashed down in [[Universe/Locations/Dermak Undercity\|Dermak]]. Simple as you goin' down there and fetching it..."

The Envoy: "Ode are after the Stag... Why?"

Avakot: "Look 'round 'ere. These [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Ichor\|sludge]] slingers can't stand the sight o' somethin' wild. Ode don't like their stuff antler-bashed anymore than I like snivellin' in that crate."

The Envoy: "Need a kerchief?"

Avakot: "Need these sludge spewers to get gone. Can't get a breath in edge-wise."

The Envoy: "What's your story?"

Avakot: "Story? No story really. Sprouted up in a patch just 'fore [[Universe/Events/The Felling\|the sky got kicked down]]. Had us a clean, wet river, not like this greasy one. But those spiders fell, and [[Universe/Events/The Dread Song\|that ditty rang out]] and, all you big legs lost your nerve. Well, me and mine got rounded up, 'cause me and mine don't hear music the same as you lot. I got away, I got snatched, I got away. So 'ere I stand, tall as I am. Name's A- Ah- Avakot. Might be you use this. One of those talky Ode things. On dah patch, my treat."

Deora (Intercepted transmission): "Lord [[Universe/Characters/Ode'n/Synod\|Synod]], the great stag will be yours come moonrise. You may send your [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Collector\|Collector]]."

Orlick: "Ah, a relic of pre-Ode'n wars. The fire king, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/Fenn Jotar\|Fenn Jotar]] built this place. The [[Universe/Locations/Dermak Undercity\|Undercity of Dermak]]! The old traps. Sharp as ever.

Deora (Intercepted transmission): "Synod's Collector is dispatched. Scour every yard of that tomb and prepare for him a tribute. These histories must burn, or more [[Universe/The World of Ode/Gruul\|Gruul]]s will come."

Avakot: "Psst! Big legs! Oy leggy!! (sneezes) Sun's arse! Choke me with sludge, [[Universe/Factions and Species/Sinecure\|the cans]] are everywhere, huh? I was gonna show you the vault, buuuuut... I'm good here. Just up ahead, and left, ya can't miss it.. (sneezes) Or was it right?"

Orlick: "There's an old [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] belief that waterfalls signify abundance... (chuckles) Dead and still my bladder haunts!"

Orlick: "Good! Now let your familiar be our guide! (whispering) Ah. I suppose Little Genius, in a way, you are. Do you feel that, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|envoy]]? The air falls heavy here, a disruption in the ley. Old Jotar wanders near."

Fenn Jotar: "Widows and maids, to tyrants embrace. Once liberty came, to flame encased. What peace is that? A great king's word ought be of honor. Not a spark for mobs of horror. Amnesty. Amnesty! I needn't eyes... to recognize. Another penitent... of ashen allies. My torch is yours. See the sparks of shame within. So we join, with flame, as kin. Light the way. By [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]'s rays, blaze!"

Deora (Intercepted transmission) : "There's [[Universe/The World of Ode/Gruul\|Gruul]] among you! [[Universe/Characters/Ode'n/Synod\|Synod]] will have me sky-wheeled if his tribute is lightened. Find the Gruul and send them back to the fires of [[Universe/The World of Ode/Kur\|Kur]]."

Fenn: "Ashed and cratered! Burn, invader!"

Orlick: "Alca quivers in anger! The Ode take too much!"

Fenn: "To feel the flames of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] true... Her arms entwined in [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]] blue... (sighs) But I cannot."

Orlick: "Fascinating... The souls severed, separate, anew... Now to find the aforementioned 'secret-y glade.' (whispering) Yes, I know it's not a real word!"

Deora (Intercepted transmission): "The [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Collector\|Collector]] has landed. Make your preparations."

(Young Deora plays with a young [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]] in a flashback)

Orlick: "The totem reveals! Here, Envoy! Here!"

Orlick: "The fabled [[Universe/Locations/Andurin Glades\|Glades of Andurin]]! But where are the [[Universe/The World of Alca/Voicing Trees\|Voicing Trees]]? The shimmering [[Picktrix\|Picktrix]]?! Have the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]] engines made it even here?! These histories, Envoy! A mythical stag, the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Omen Beast\|Omen Beast]] of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] people. [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Alca\|Alca]]'s children, all. Some way of aligning the symbolic herd? See you any magicks that might offer a clue? 'The mighty stag leads where his herd follows.' An excerpt from my stirring treatise, [[Internal Essence of the Antlered and Behooved\|Internal Essence of the Antlered and Behooved]]. You have foreseen what lies beyond. We... we might need to stay here to... to document these invaluable histories!"

([[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|The Envoy]] enters a clearing where [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Knightmaidens/Lady Deora\|Lady Deora]] is corrupting The Stag)

Deora: "There, there you're soon to be one of us... Just as you were, traitor. HOLD! You seek a pact with these wretched beasts... (chuckles) Fine... let your fates be intertwined. (laughs) You defy us! Yet no child sleeps cold but for the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]]? The Ode put fire in every hearth. Betrayer! The Ode brought abundance. Would you deprive us? What part of history need you return? Famine? War? The Ode have banished chaos. (gasps) What are you doing? (gasps)"

(The Envoy drags Deora into [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/The Nightfold\|The Nightfold]] and plays the song of her childhood from the flashback earlier)

Deora: "I... I know this... song... what... evil grasp have I? I am damned, eternal."

([[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]], corrupted by [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Ichor\|Ichor]], has now become [[The Torment Stag\|The Torment Stag]] and attacks [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|The Envoy]]. [[Universe/Songs/Rivers of Dendria\|Rivers of Dendria]] plays during the fight.)

([[Universe/Characters/Alca/Omen Beasts/Garren Rood\|Garren Rood]], cleansed of [[Universe/The World of Ode/Ode'n Tech/Ichor\|Ichor]], approaches Deora)

Deora: "Garren. Thank you."

Garren: "You. I do not know you. You look like the [[Cleggs\|Cleggs]] that skinned my lovers... who brined my rivers... who smeared their metal bowels on every wind. (sniffs) Hmmm! Yet you bare the ancient scent of kin... can it be you are an [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]] the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Empress Alora\|Empress]] spoke of? Yes? Yes! I am Garren Rood. Stag of the [[Universe/Locations/Andurin Glades\|Andurin Glades]], [[Universe/Factions and Species/Omen Beast\|Omen]]-Ward of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] herds. [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|Envoy]], I offer you... the grace of my crown...."
