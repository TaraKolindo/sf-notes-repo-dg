**Doyen**: "Well I remember her face..."
	-"Like fallen snow, like petal fair, A'glow was she, and oh, her hair..."
	-"As [[Universe/The World of Alca/Festivals/Thawtide\|Thawtide]]'s haze cast sun through rain, So fresh was she, and of her mane..."
    -"A copper glow, like amber rocks, A wealth of warmth, and of her locks..."
	-"So graced of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] fair, Her face sang sun, and oh, her hair..."
    -"As of cosmos, seas deep, nights depthless, Divine was she, and of her tresses..."
Hair:
	-"A downy cloud blown 'cross the skies,"
	-"Of coiled shoots, of twisted vines,"
	-"Knotted round as cone of pine,"
	-"Like [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|wevet]] roots three intertwined,"
	-"A woven crown in careful ties,"
Hair Colour:
	-"Such fletching gold shone 'round her eyes..."
	-"And fawnish tawny 'round her eyes..."
	-"Such foxen ember lit her eyes..."
	-"Like brood-ling bear fur ov'r eyes..."
	-"Like nightlark feathers ov'r her eyes..."
Eyes:
	-"Of salt'n waves, her gaze did flow..."
	-"Like sproutling seed, their green bid growth..."
	-"T'were [[Universe/The World of Alca/Silvern\|silvern]] grey as armour glow..."
	-"Of honey mead, of spotted doe..."
	-"Like dusky ley of [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]] low..."
"Last love she saw was you, I know. Love last it was that sent you so."
"It began as [[Universe/Events/The Dread Song\|song]], pitched sweet and solemn; and they that heard, 'came [[Universe/Factions and Species/Thrall\|hollow, fallen.]] Their children raised in castles loft, made [[Universe/Factions and Species/Tempest\|hunters]], grave; of others, not."
[[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]] ???: "Remember this: we... are a family."
