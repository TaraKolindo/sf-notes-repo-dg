[[Universe/Factions and Species/Kith of Kings\|Kith of Kings]]:
	Note:
		I have studied long the statue of the [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Dendria/Clan Jotar/Fenn Jotar\|Fire King]].
		Yet still cannot grasp how such remorse be carved into stone.
		Nor who sealed his crypt ‘fore I could return.
		Can a memorial feel shame?

	When twin suns ([[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] and [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Saphene\|Saphene]]) sleep. When mem'ries creep. A spirit sweeps. Keeper of keys.
		Ashen Spirit: "Sun shone ye off. He sits upon a throne of ash. ??? by [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]]'s lash. ??? Leave the fallen King to the crypt. Mora damn you. Unforgivable."
	Fenn: "A great king's word aught be of honor, not a spark for mobs of horror. Amnesty. Amnesty! Where was my [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Courage\|courage]]?"
