***Lightning cracks where thunder bodes. Voltaics strike against their own. Rebind your arm to Tempest [[Universe/Factions and Species/Ode\|Ode]].** Harness the power of Ode'n technology. Though freed [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|you]] are, your Tempest training may prove useful still. May they rue the day they stole your frame.* - Ode Tempest Pact
