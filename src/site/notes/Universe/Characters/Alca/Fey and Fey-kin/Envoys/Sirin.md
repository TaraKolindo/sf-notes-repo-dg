*Borne of a moonlight pond, was he, with an arrow ready-nocked. Take the pact of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]] assassin, Sirin. Learn the trickster's glamour, wear the ranger's shroud. Have [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Grace\|Grace]], [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]]. For a well-aimed bolt may end a world. It has done so once before.* - [[Universe/Items and Equipment/Pacts/Base Pacts/Sirin Pact\|Sirin Pact]]
