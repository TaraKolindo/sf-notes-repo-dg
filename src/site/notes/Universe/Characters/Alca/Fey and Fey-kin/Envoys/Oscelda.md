*Roused by rain, was she, a new witch abloom in the garden of [[Universe/The World of Alca/Eldveil\|Eldveil]]. Share the pact of the [[Universe/Factions and Species/Fey\|Fey]] healer, Oscelda. Fend the thriving, tend the ailing, and mend the damned. Have [[Universe/The World of Alca/Magicks/Virtues/Spirit\|Spirit]], [[Universe/Factions and Species/Envoy\|Envoy]]. For all of us living share the same breath. Forget it is so, and choke.* - [[Universe/Items and Equipment/Pacts/Base Pacts/Oscelda Pact\|Oscelda Pact]]
