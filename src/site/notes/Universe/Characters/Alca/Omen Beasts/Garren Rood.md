*Stag of the [[Universe/Locations/Andurin Glades\|Andurin Glades]], Omen-Ward of the [[Universe/Locations/Dendria\|Dendrit]] herds.*

*Royal tines thus graced in blue, Skyward bent to [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Gods of Alca/Mora\|Mora]] true. Take ye the pact of Garren Rood, the great spirit stag of the Andurin Glades. Bear blessing and burden of the Dendrit herds through bounty of seedtime and hollow of frostfall, both.*
