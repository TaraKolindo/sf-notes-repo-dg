*The Arbearer, the Omen Bear.*

***When giants fall, when fail our brutes, 'Tis strength to turn to severed roots. And bear to look within for truce.** Bear the burly pact of the Arbearer, Bromius. Be ward of the [[Universe/Locations/Wevetwood\|Wevetwood]], regent of the [[Universe/Locations/Neath'uns\|Neath'uns]]' roots. Mighty, you must be. Of heft and heart alike.*
