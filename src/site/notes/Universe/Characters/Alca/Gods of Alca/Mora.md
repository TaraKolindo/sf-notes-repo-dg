*Her ever-flame will she impart, To braving souls with burning hearts. Not life nor death will do you part. Take Mora's Hand, [[Universe/Characters/Alca/Fey and Fey-kin/Envoys/The Envoy\|Envoy]]. Make a pact with the red sun. An honour once held only by the mighty Kings and Queens of [[Universe/Locations/Midrath\|Midrath]] is yours. Do not sully her flame.* - Mora's Hand Pact
